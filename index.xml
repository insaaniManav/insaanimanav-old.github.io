      <description>But why do I need to sign my commits Git is cryptographically secure. But as with most things on the internet, you can&amp;rsquo;t trust what you see. But you don&amp;rsquo;t have to extremely skeptical either, the least you can do is ensure that whatever stuff you put on there is trusted and verified.
What exactly Is GPG? GPG stands for GnuPG which is a free implementation of the OpenPGP standard for encryption.</description>

      <description>OS wars part 2 So It&amp;rsquo;s the year 1991, Microsoft and Apple have been trading blows for decades now and finally the war ground is about to settle, then comes along Linux and s, Microsoft reals and regroups.

      <description>KDE connect - &amp;ldquo;The companion app that we deserve&amp;rdquo; Linking my phone with my computer has always been of concern. I mean, If I want to send a file to my computer, How do I do it? Email it to me? Somehow send it to me on Telegram? All these are tedious ways and not very efficient in nature. One fix if you are a techie is to use maybe create a wrapper around SFTP(Simple File Transfer Protocol) and use it to send files.</description>

      <description>cd command cd stands for change directory putting the directory name in front of the cd command lets you change to that directory A little caveat is that /home/username is your main home directory which is the default for all terminal editors and that is also aliased to ~ Basically both of these are the same
cd /home/insaanimanav/Videos cd ~/Videos This is probably the single most useful command that you will use while using the command line</description>

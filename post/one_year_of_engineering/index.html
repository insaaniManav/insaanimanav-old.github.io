    <p class="lead">A rant</p>
    <h1 id="why-engineering">Why Engineering</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>If I throw a stone from my house in any direction, I am sure to hit atleast 2 people who   have an enginering degree</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A common saying in India</li>
</ul>
<p>I was recently talking to an aquintance of mine helping him install Linux on his machine and in the middle of our conversation he said and I quote</p>
<pre><code>Tu kya ye open-source karta rehta hai . Aage jaake tughe bhi to hamari tarah DS-ALGO karke placement hi leni hai 
</code></pre><p>For people who are not Hindi speaking this roughly translates to</p>
<pre><code>Why do you always keep talking about open-source. You will also just learn DS-ALGO like all of us and try and compete for a placement
</code></pre><p>This line of his made me question the entire thought proccess a student has while applying to an engineering college.</p>
<p>Three of my close elder cousins are all software engineers so naturally I grew up listening to stories of the projects that they had to build or the assignments that they had to solve and in general of how and what engineering life is like in India. This lead me to believing falsely that engineering is all about creating things and having fun in those four years of college .
Now when I am currently pursuing engineering, there are very few people who actually confirm to my idealogy of what its like. Most people here are only here to get placed into a company right from the first year.</p>
<p>The other day I overheard a bunch of my friends solving a question on one of the competitive programming sites . I tried my hand at it too.
It took us some time but the three of us figured it out in the end and wrote a solution. I I was pretty happy that we did finally do it. But one of friends exclaimed</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yar ye sawal mai itna time laga diya hamne, jab paper hoga to kaise karenge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which translates to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This question took us so much time how will we do it in the coding round of placements</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>He is no longer my friend</em></p>
<h2 id="message-to-people-who-are-about-to-start-engineering-or-have-just-started-it">Message to people who are about to start engineering or have just started it</h2>
<p>Please dont fall into this trap of &ldquo;DS Algo Karke Placement&rdquo; . In the end you might get a really good placement at FAANG but how would you justify those four years of engineering.
After preparing 2 years for JEE You ended up in an engineering college, Please spend time creating and learning new things rather than converting 4 years of engineering into JEE and end up ruining them as well.</p>

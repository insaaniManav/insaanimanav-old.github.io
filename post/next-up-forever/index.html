    <p>Next Up Forever - AJR - Neotheatre</p>
<p>So this is the first one in a series of blog posts I am going to write about songs that I like and which are very close to my heart. I frankly just wanted to pour out my thoughts about some things and I realized that since nobody visits this corner of the web so why not here.</p>
<p>This post is about a song called</p>
<h1 id="next-up-forever">Next Up Forever</h1>
<p>The basic essence of this song this how anything seems better when it is about to come up and seems meh when you are finally experiencing it. The Idea for this song came from analogy with food .
Similar to how when you are waiting for your food to arrive you are much more excited as compared to when the food arrives and you start eating it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your eyes are open<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So never close them<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
You&rsquo;ll sail the ocean<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Finding where you should be<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And if you&rsquo;re broken<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
You&rsquo;ll make your own thing&lt;br?&gt;
You&rsquo;ll make it so big<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
For all the world to see<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
You&rsquo;ll make it so damn big<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
For all the world to see<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The songs starts out beautifully and the first stanza tells us about how we should never think about giving up and closing our eyes. Keep them open so that we can sail this never ending ocean of opportunities. At the end even if you dont find your thing, you&rsquo;ll make something on your own and make it so damn big in it that the whole world will see.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m kinda scared to drop this album<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Let&rsquo;s push it back another week<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I wanna be next up forever<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Find a way to never hit my peak<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I kinda wish I was still a virgin<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Time to finally see what sex is like<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I wanna be next up forever<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Forever I&rsquo;ll be second in line<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first line itself we get the essence about how AJR was a little scared to drop this album altogether since it was something new that they had never done before. Sure this could lead to some fans leaving them but this could also lead to newer fans joining.
It&rsquo;s expressed here so perfectly about how you could find a way to never hit your peak, keep growing and growing, it would be amazing.
The fourth line  <code>I kinda wish I was still a virgin</code> brings us back to the food analogy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someday they&rsquo;ll be talking about me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Right now they&rsquo;re just walking around me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
My God, are you growing without me?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Somebody help me (somebody help me)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Someday they&rsquo;ll be talking about me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Right now they&rsquo;re just walking around me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
My God, are you growing without me?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Somebody help me (somebody help me, somebody help me, somebody help me<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This are some amazing lines that keep me going in the hardest of the times .The fact about how someday your friends or the people around you will talk highly of you. About what you used to be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is my imagination<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This is how it looks and sounds<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
But I gotta go so much bigger<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So they can never shut me down<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I&rsquo;m kinda scared of graduation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lsquo;Cause who am I when this is done?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I wanna be next up forever<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So the best is always yet to come<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unarguably the best parts of this song. This tells about how sometimes you get this weird feeling that a certain thing you made or something you did seems only good to you and nobody else will like it.
``I&rsquo;m kinda scared of graduation ``` tells us about how not everyone has everything figured out in life But at a certain point before graduating you feel the pressure of atleast trying to figure out who you are and where exactly do you wanna go in life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I gotta go so much bigger<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So everybody&rsquo;s proud of me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Welcome to the Neotheater<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Won&rsquo;t everybody take their seats?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And I&rsquo;ll be next up forever<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s coming next<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I know I gotta grow up sometime<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
But I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ready yet<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse that gives us a gentle intro to their album. Hearing <code>Welcome to the Neotheater</code> literally gave me goosebumps.
In this verse they also taklk about this amazing concept of about how you want to next up forever since you have no idea whats coming up next in your life. you just wanna stand back and see the other person do it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know I gotta grow up sometime<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
But I&rsquo;m not fucking ready yet<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Your eyes are open<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So never close them<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
You&rsquo;ll sail the ocean<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Finding where you should be<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And if you&rsquo;re broken<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
You&rsquo;ll make your own thing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
You&rsquo;ll make it so big<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
For all the world to see<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
You&rsquo;ll make it so damn big<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
For all the world to see<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know I gotta grow up sometime but I&rsquo;m not fucking ready yet also conveys the same concept of how we just wanna always stay in school, stay in college because we dont have life all figured out around us and we dont want to figure it out just yet. And these lines mark the concluding paragraph of a song whos beats are as beautiful as its lyrics</p>

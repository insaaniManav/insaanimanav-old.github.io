      <description>So this is the first one in a series of blog posts I am going to write about songs that I like and which are very close to my heart. I frankly just wanted to pour out my thoughts about some things and I realized that since nobody visits this corner of the web so why not here.
The basic essence of this song this how anything seems better when it is about to come up and seems meh when you are finally experiencing it.</description>
